## 🔧 Methodology
### ✔ Sensor & Data Collection  
Ultrasonic sensor measures water level by calculating sound wave travel time.

### ✔ Microcontroller Processing  
ESP8266 computes distance and converts it into percentage of tank fill.

### ✔ IoT Communication  
Data is sent via WiFi to **Adafruit IO dashboard**.

### ✔ Automation  
Pump is automatically switched ON/OFF based on water level thresholds.

### ✔ Manual Override  
User can control pump manually using the Adafruit IO app.
